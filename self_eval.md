# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I struggled with the last question in hashes_2 exercise. It took a couple of attempts to get the code to run successfully, but I spent about 10 minutes working out the problem. 
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
Note taking is going well. I take notes on the lessons and videos. I like to have examples to use when I'm working in the future. When I write out examples of how to run the different exercises it is the most helpful. 
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
I try and solve it on my own for about 5 to 10 minutes before jumping over to Google for the answer.
